# 🌤️ Weather App

Hi Guys, here I made a simple web app to display the current weather using the OpenWeatherMap API. 
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Hope You Love it :)

## 🧠 How It Works

- JavaScript sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
- The response contains real-time weather data.
- The page updates with temperature, condition, humidity, and location.
